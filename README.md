# Hi, I’m Kah Keen 👋

Frontend software engineer. Builder by habit. Curious by nature.

I work on turning unclear ideas into calm, usable products.
Most of my work lives at the intersection of **frontend engineering, system thinking, and product sense** — where clarity matters more than cleverness.

---

## What I do

- Build maintainable frontend systems (Vue, React, TypeScript)
- Design interfaces that reduce friction, not add to it
- Take ownership from idea → implementation → iteration
- Work comfortably in fast-moving, imperfect environments

I value decisions that age well, code that future me won’t hate, and products that respect users’ attention.

---

## How I think

- Clarity > complexity  
- Simple systems scale better than clever ones  
- Fewer things, done well  
- Build things that compound over time  

I’m interested in long-term thinking — in code, products, and life.

---

## Outside of code

When I’m not coding, I’m usually:
- Cooking 
- Learning and reading
- Spending time outdoors
- Traveling slowly 

I’m exploring a flexible, location-independent way of working that leaves space for both deep focus and real experiences.

## Currently

- Building and maintaining frontend products
- Exploring indie projects and product ideas
- Improving my craft, one iteration at a time
